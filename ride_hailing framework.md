# Key Components:
Demand (Passengers): Want rides based on price, wait time, and alternatives (e.g., buses, taxis).
Supply (Drivers): Decide to work based on wages, incentives, and other job options.
Platform: Balances the two by setting prices, wages, matching riders with drivers, and more.
Endogenous Variables: Things like wait times and driver income that affect each other in a feedback loop.
Objectives: Platforms juggle goals like profit, market share, or social good (e.g., reducing traffic).
